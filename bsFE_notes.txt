After some testing, it appears to check in the folder the bios is located in. This seems a bit unintuitive but is workable. If this was documented somewhere and I missed it, I am sorry for bothering you. I tried looking at the auto generated manifest but that required me compiling a newer version of bsnes plus myself and I am really bad at setting up tool chains.
