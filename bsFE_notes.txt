BSFE MAP 1
LoRom 1MB
No copier header

japanese stored in shift japanese
manifest.bml is for higan
romname.xml is for byuu

checksum only looks at the information based on the header

Aquick patch to the checksum patcher was in order
dont worry about file error 4, I made a more adanced python 
varient for non windows systems

For video playback the 16bit NMI and IRQ interupts 
will need to be hacked.

Turns out NMI isnt needed and IRQ is dealt with through sram.
that not cleared on initialisation.

I now need to add a way to skip video and error detection in case
the time is set wrong or the msu1 file is not dected.
Skip video based on time or input
